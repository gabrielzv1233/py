this is litterally just a repo with a crap ton of refrence code or small little projects that i made<br>
ususally i make most of my projects in this repo than decide i want to make it its own project, you can see alot of leftover/old scripts here that have since been upgraded<br>
there is still code from my fortnite status checker discord bot here, and FunnyAltF4<br>
most projects start off with a example from chatGPT to give me an example of what a working program looks like, than i recode it after messing around with the AI generated code (works supprisingly well for learning languages)
an example of this is `detoxify/detoxify-test.py` was generated using chatGPT than i made it into `detoxify/detoxify-UI.py`<br>
legacy scripts folder is archived versions of stuff, please keep in mind i dont really orginize the folders so it prob dont make sense where stuff is

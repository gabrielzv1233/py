Yes, you can forcefully terminate a Python script from within the script itself using the following methods:

### 1. **Using `os._exit()`**
This method will terminate the Python script immediately without cleaning up resources (like open files or network connections).

```python
import os

os._exit(1)  # Use exit code 1 (non-zero means an error occurred)
```

### 2. **Using `sys.exit()`**
This method will raise a `SystemExit` exception, which can be caught. If you want a forceful exit that doesn't allow the script to continue under any circumstance, combine it with `os._exit()`.

```python
import sys

sys.exit(0)  # Exit code 0 indicates success
```

### 3. **Killing the script via `psutil` (when compiled or running)**
You can use the `psutil` library to find and kill the current process forcefully, which will work whether the script is running as a `.py` file or as a compiled executable.

First, install `psutil`:
```bash
pip install psutil
```

Hereâ€™s how you can forcefully terminate the script using `psutil`:

```python
import psutil
import os

current_process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
current_process.kill()  # Force kills the current process
```

This approach ensures that the script is completely terminated.

### 4. **Killing the script in `pyinstaller` compiled mode**
When the script is compiled using `pyinstaller`, the `psutil` method or `os._exit()` will still work. If you want to bind this behavior to a specific event (like pressing a tray menu item), you can do that as well.

For example, you could modify the tray menu to have a "Force Quit" option:
```python
from pystray import MenuItem
import os

def force_quit(icon, item):
    os._exit(1)  # Force quit

# Add "Force Quit" menu item
menu = Menu(
    MenuItem('Send Notification', lambda: show_notification()),
    MenuItem('Force Quit', force_quit)
)
```

This way, when the "Force Quit" option is selected, it will immediately terminate the script.
